Installation instructions for the Thea library

Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Nov 2010
========================================================================

Installation is a two-step process. First, one installs the support
libraries for Thea, and then builds Thea itself. By and large, we
provide a installation script for the support libraries (*nix) or
prebuilt versions (Windows). Since we can't account for every
possible chain of sub-dependencies or OS/compiler combinations, you may
need to install one or more libraries yourself.

On all platforms, please *install CMake* (preferably the latest version)
first.

Then, select a location where you want Thea installed, e.g. /usr/local
or C:\Thea. We'll refer to this folder as <install-dir> below.

===================================
Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS X)
===================================

* Installing the support libraries:

(Replace <N> with the number of simultaneous make process you want to
run. This is usually the number of cores on your system.)

WITH root privileges:
- sudo Code/Dependencies/install-defaults --use-root --user <your-username> --prefix <install-dir> [-j<N>]

OR

WITHOUT root privileges (make sure you can write to <install-dir>):
- Code/Dependencies/install-defaults --prefix <install-dir> [-j<N>]

The install-defaults script calls Installations/install to install the
required libraries. Use the latter script directly to selectively
install dependencies.


* Installing Thea:

- Switch to Code/Build.

- Run: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir>
             [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo]
             .

  - Don't forget the '.' (period) denoting the current directory at the
    end!

  - At this stage, CMake may report some dependencies not installed by
    the first step as missing. Sorry, our script doesn't cover every
    possible dependency! Please install the missing libraries manually.

  - It is technically possible to install the support libraries to a
    different directory than the install directory for Thea. The former
    directory must be then be specified by setting
    THEA_INSTALLATIONS_ROOT. This is not recommended in general.

- Run: make [-j<N>]

- Run: [sudo] make install

- [Optional] To make the test suite as well, add -DWITH_TESTS to the
  cmake line, and then run "make TheaTests". The test programs will be
  built, but not installed. You can run them from Code/Build/Output/bin.

- [Optional] To generate documentation for Thea, run Doxygen in
  Code/Documentation.

Windows

These instructions are for Visual Studio (tested with VS 2008 on Windows
7).

* Installing the support libraries:

- Boost: Run the installer in Code/Dependencies/Prebuilt/Win{32|64}/Setup.

- CGAL: We can't provide a prebuilt version of CGAL since it installs
  some configuration files that uses hardcoded paths specific to the
  local system. To build and install CGAL, follow these steps:

  - Make sure Boost is installed (previous step).

  - Run the installer in Code/Dependencies/Prebuilt/Win{32|64}/Setup and
    install to (say) C:/CGAL-src. This just installs the *source*
    distribution, this is NOT the final installed set of libraries.

  - Run CMake in C:/CGAL-src to generate CGAL.sln. It should find the
    Boost libraries you installed above.

  - Build CGAL.sln with Visual Studio.

  - Build the INSTALL subproject of CGAL.sln to install the libraries
    in <install-dir>. Set CGAL_INSTALL_PREFIX to <install-dir> to
    control the install location.

  - The last three steps can be run from the command line (in the
    Code/Dependencies/CGAL directory) as:
    - cmake -DCGAL_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir> .
      (don't forget the final dot for the current directory)
    - devenv /Build {Debug|Release} CGAL.sln
    - devenv /Build {Debug|Release} /Project INSTALL CGAL.sln

- Everything else: Copy (via the SVN "export" command if you checked out
  the source from the SVN repository) the "include" and "lib
  subdirectories of Code/Dependencies/Prebuilt/Win{32|64} to
  <install-dir>.


* Installing Thea:

- Run CMake in Code/Build, setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
  <install-dir>. This should produce Thea.sln.

  - It is technically possible to install the support libraries to a
    different directory than the install directory for Thea. The former
    directory must be then be specified by setting
    THEA_INSTALLATIONS_ROOT. This is not recommended in general.

- Build Thea.sln with Visual Studio.

- Build the INSTALL subproject of Thea.sln to install the Thea library
  in <install-dir>.

- The steps can be run from the command line (in Code/Build) as:
  - cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir> .
    (don't forget the final dot for the current directory)
  - devenv /Build {Debug|Release} Thea.sln
  - devenv /Build {Debug|Release} /Project INSTALL Thea.sln
