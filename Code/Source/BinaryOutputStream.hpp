 *
 * Any method call can trigger an out-of-memory error when writing to a memory buffer if it can't be expanded any more.
 *
 * This class does <b>not</b> use overloading to distinguish between writing, say, a float and a double. Instead, the write
 * functions are explicitly named writeFloat32(), writeFloat64() etc. This is because it would be very hard to debug the error
 * sequence: <code>bo.write(1.0); ... float f = bi.readFloat32();</code> in which a double is serialized and then deserialized
 * as a float.
 *
 * Derived from the G3D library: http://g3d.sourceforge.net
