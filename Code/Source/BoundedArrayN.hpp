/**
 * An array of bounded maximum size N, stored on the stack. No new elements can be added to the end of the array once it reaches
 * its maximum capacity, until some are removed via erase(). Elements can be inserted in the middle of the array even when it is
 * full: in this case the last element is dropped to make space. This class is useful for very fast allocation of space for a
 * few elements, where the exact number of elements is not known but is guaranteed to have an upper limit.
 *
 * To get some extra speed when T has a trivial (bit-copy) assignment operator, make sure that
 * <tt>boost::has_trivial_assign</tt> is true for T.
 *
 * The implementation always allocates enough space to store the maximum number of instances of T. The capacity N should be
 * <b>positive</b> (non-zero).
 *
 * For a bounded stack-based array that also guarantees that its elements are in sorted order, see BoundedSortedArrayN.
