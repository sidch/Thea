/**
 * A simple style tokenizer for reading text files. TextInputStream handles a superset of C++, Java, Matlab, and Bash code text
 * including single line comments, block comments, quoted strings with escape sequences, and operators. TextInputStream
 * recognizes several categories of tokens, which are separated by white space, quotation marks, or the end of a
 * recognized operator:
 *
 * - Token::ExtendedType::SINGLE_QUOTED: string of characters surrounded by single quotes, e.g. 'x', '\\0', 'foo'.
 * - Token::ExtendedType::DOUBLE_QUOTED: string of characters surrounded by double quotes, e.g. "x", "abc\txyz", "b o b".
 * - Token::ExtendedType::SYMBOL: legal C++ operators, keywords, and identifiers. e.g. >=, Foo, _X, class, {
 * - Token::ExtendedType::INTEGER: numbers without decimal places or exponential notation. e.g. 10, 0x17F, 32, 0, -155
 * - Token::ExtendedType::FLOATING_POINT: numbers with decimal places or exponential notation. e.g. 1e3, -1.2, .4, 0.5
 * - Token::ExtendedType::BOOLEAN: special symbols like "true" and "false"; the exact details can be configured in
 *   TextInputStream::Settings
 * - Token::ExtendedType::LINE_COMMENT: (disabled by default); generated for line comments as specified by
 *   TextInputStream::Settings
 * - Token::ExtendedType::BLOCK_COMMENT: (disabled by default); generated for C-style block comments as specified by
 *   TextInputStream::Settings
 * - Token::ExtendedType::NEWLINE: (disabled by default); generated for any of "\\r", "\\n" or "\\r\\n"
 *
 * The special ".." and "..." tokens are always recognized in addition to normal C++ operators. Additional tokens can be made
 * available by changing the Settings.
 *
 * Negative numbers are handled specially because of the ambiguity between unary minus and negative numbers -- see the note for
 * TextInputStream::read().
 *
 * Inside quoted strings escape sequences are converted. Thus the string token for ["a\\nb"] is 'a', followed by a newline,
 * followed by 'b'. Outside of quoted strings, escape sequences are not converted, so the token sequence for [a\\nb] is symbol
 * 'a', symbol '\\', symbol 'nb' (this matches what a C++ parser would do). The exception is that a specified
 * TextInputStream::Settings::otherCommentCharacter preceeded by a backslash is assumed to be an escaped comment character and
 * is returned as a symbol token instead of being parsed as a comment (this is what a LaTeX or VRML parser would do).
 *
 * Assumes that the file is not modified once opened.
 *
 * <b>Examples</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * TextInputStream ti(TextInputStream::FROM_STRING, "name = \"Max\", height = 6");
 *
 * Token t;
 *
 * t = ti.read();
 * assert(t.type == Token::Type::SYMBOL);
 * assert(t.sval == "name");
 *
 * t = ti.read();
 * assert(t.type == Token::Type::SYMBOL);
 * assert(t.sval == "=");
 *
 * std::string name = ti.read().sval;
 * ti.read();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * TextInputStream ti(TextInputStream::FROM_STRING, "name = \"Max\", height = 6");
 * ti.readSymbols("name", "=");
 * std::string name = ti.readString();
 * ti.readSymbols(",", "height", "=");
 * double height = ti. readNumber();
