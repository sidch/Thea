/**
 * Interface for solvers of systems of linear equations. The matrices must currently be real. The matrix should be a (row-major
 * or column-major) Matrix, CompressedRowMatrix, or CompressedColumnMatrix. Several other matrix types may be converted to these
 * types by the relevant constructors.
 *
 * If the matrix is square and of full rank, the solver should compute the unique solution. Else, if the matrix is rectangular,
 * it should try to return an approximate solution (typically one that minimizes the squared error). In the latter case, classes
 * implementing the LinearSolver interface may be considered alternatives to the default linear least-squares solvers provided
 * by LinearLeastSquares.
 *
 * To create an instance of a LinearSolver, one typically loads the plugin for the relevant implementation and calls
 * LinearSolverFactory::createLinearSolver().
 *
 * @note A derived class typically needs to implement only the solve() function, and optionally getPreferredFormat(). To solve
 * the system <b>Ax = b</b>, the solve() function reads the coefficient matrix <b>A</b> from #coeffs and the constant vector
 * <b>b</b> from #constants. If the system is successfully solved, #has_solution is set to true and the %solution placed in
 * #solution. Else, #has_solution is set to false.
