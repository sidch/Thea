To build with Visual Studio 10:

- Open the VC9 (*not* VC10) project.

- Change the "Output File" properties of the appropriate projects/configurations to:
  * $(OutDir)G3D.lib
  * $(OutDir)G3Dd.lib
  * $(OutDir)jpeg.lib
  * $(OutDir)png.lib
  * $(OutDir)tiff.lib
  * $(OutDir)zip.lib
  * $(OutDir)zlib.lib

  (The $(SafeParentName) stuff doesn't work.)

- Build the G3D.lib project in both Debug and Release modes.
